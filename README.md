## 🧰 Requirements
- A Chromebook that supports **Linux (Crostini)**
- At least **10 GB** of free storage
- ChromeOS updated to the latest version
- A stable internet connection

---

## ✅ Step 1: Check Chromebook Compatibility  

Make sure that your Chromebook supports **Linux (Crostini)**.  
👉 [Check Chromebook Compatibility](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-linux/)

---

## ⚙️ Step 2: Enable Linux (Crostini)

1. Open **Settings**  
2. Go to **Developers → Linux development environment (Beta)**  
3. Click **Set up**  
4. Enter a **username** (keep it appropriate 😅)  
5. Choose a **disk size**  
   - 💾 *Minimum:* 10 GB (required)  
   - 💾 *Recommended:* 20 GB+  
   - 💾 *Maximum:* ~38 GB (all depending on your storage capacity)  
6. Click **Install**

⏱️ *Installation takes about 2–5 minutes depending on your device and chosen disk size.*

💡 **Pro Tip**: You can always resize your Linux container later in Settings if you need more space!

---

## 💻 Step 3: First Boot  

Once installation is complete, the **Linux terminal** should open automatically!  

Run these commands to update your system:  

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Then, check if any other packages can be updated:  

```bash
apt list --upgradable
```

✅ This will ensure your Linux setup is fully up to date with the latest software and security patches.

## 🧩 Command Breakdown

| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `sudo apt update` | Refreshes available package info |
| `sudo apt upgrade -y` | Installs the latest updates automatically |
| `apt list --upgradable` | Shows packages that can still be updated |

---

## 📋 Quick Command Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Update packages | `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y` |
| Install a program | `sudo apt install <program-name>` |
| Remove a program | `sudo apt remove <program-name>` |
| Search for packages | `apt search <keyword>` |
| Clear terminal | `clear` or `Ctrl+L` |
| Exit terminal | `exit` or `Ctrl+D` |
| View command history | `history` |
| Get help for a command | `man <command>` or `<command> --help` |

---

## 🔧 Optional: Install Useful Tools

Here are some beginner-friendly apps and tools you can install:

```bash
sudo apt install git
sudo apt install neofetch
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo apt install nano
sudo apt install htop
sudo apt install curl
```

Run `neofetch` after installing to see your Linux info! 😄

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Linux won't install?
- Make sure ChromeOS is fully updated (Settings → About ChromeOS → Check for updates)
- Check you have enough storage space available
- Try restarting your Chromebook and attempting installation again
- Ensure your Chromebook model supports Linux ([check compatibility](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-linux/))

### Terminal won't open?
- Right-click the Terminal icon in your app launcher → Open
- Or search "Terminal" in your ChromeOS app launcher
- Try Settings → Developers → Linux → Remove, then reinstall

### Commands not working?
- Make sure you're typing them exactly as shown (Linux is case-sensitive!)
- Check your internet connection for package downloads
- Try running `sudo apt update` first
- If you get "Permission denied", make sure to use `sudo` before the command

### Need more storage?
- Settings → Developers → Linux development environment
- Click on the gear icon → Resize
- Choose your new disk size and apply
